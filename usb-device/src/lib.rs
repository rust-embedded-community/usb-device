//! Experimental device-side USB stack for embedded devices.
//!
//! ## Implementing a USB device
//!
//! A USB device consists of a [`UsbDevice`](device::UsbDevice) instance, one or more
//! [`UsbClass`](crate::class::UsbClass)es, and a platform-specific [`UsbBus`](bus::UsbBus)
//! implementation which together form a USB composite device.
//!
//! In the future USB device implementors will be able to use pre-existing peripheral driver crates
//! and USB class implementation crates. The necessary types for the basic USB composite device
//! implementation are available with:
//!
//! `use usb_device::prelude::*`.
//!
//! See the [`device`] module for a more complete example.
//!
//! ## USB classes
//!
//! For information on how to implement new USB classes, see the [`class`] module and the
//! [`TestClass`](test_class::TestClass) source code for an example of a custom USB device class
//! implementation. The necessary types for creating new classes are available with:
//!
//! `use usb_device::class_prelude::*`.
//!
//! ## USB peripheral drivers
//!
//! New peripheral driver crates can be created by implementing the [`UsbBus`](bus::UsbBus) trait.
//!
//! # Note about terminology
//!
//! This crate uses standard host-centric USB terminology for transfer directions. Therefore an OUT
//! transfer refers to a host-to-device transfer, and an IN transfer refers to a device-to-host
//! transfer. This is mainly a concern for implementing new USB peripheral drivers and USB classes,
//! and people doing that should be familiar with the USB standard.

/// To implement a new class, implement the [`UsbClass`](class::UsbClass) trait. The trait contains
/// numerous callbacks that you can use to respond to USB events. None of the methods are required,
/// and you only need to override the ones that your specific class needs to function. See the trait
/// documentation for more information on the callback methods.
///
/// Your class should *not* hold a direct reference to the [`UsbBus`](bus::UsbBus) object. Rather it
/// should take a temporary reference to the [`UsbBusAllocator`](bus::UsbBusAllocator) object
/// exposed by the bus in its constructor, and use that to allocate endpoints, as well as interface
/// and string handles. Using the [`Endpoint`](endpoint::Endpoint) handles which wrap a reference to
/// the `UsbBus` instance ensures that classes cannot inadvertently access an endpoint owned by
/// another class.
///
/// In addition to implementing the trait, add struct methods for the end-user to send and receive
/// data via your class. For example, a serial port class might have class-specific methods `read`
/// and `write` to read and write data.
