# Use a 256 byte buffer for control transfers instead of 128.

# Use larger endpoint buffers for highspeed operation (default fullspeed)
#
# Note: usb-device doesn't truly support high speed enumeration yet, so setting this will make
# TestClass only compliant with high speed mode. It may still manage to be enumerated as a full
# speed device, but the descriptors will be invalid.
